    - Tier 3 locations outperform Tier 1 and Tier 2 with $472.1K in sales, suggesting stronger consumer activity in semi-urban or developing regions.

5. **Outlet Type Insights:**
    - Supermarket Type 1 outlets dominate with $787.5K in sales, accounting for a large share of total revenue.
    - Grocery Stores and other Supermarket types have comparatively modest performance (~$130–150K each).

    - Sales saw a notable peak in 2018 ($204.5K) before stabilizing around $130K per year, showing consistent but plateaued performance post-2019.

*Recommendations: Blinkit’s revenue is largely driven by medium-sized outlets in Tier 3 regions, primarily through regular-fat and high-demand grocery categories such as Fruits & Vegetables and Snack Foods. The Supermarket Type 1 format serves as the most profitable channel. Focused marketing on underperforming categories and continued investment in Tier 3 markets could further elevate overall sales performance..*
